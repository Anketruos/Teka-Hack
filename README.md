# Evalytics

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Teachers often finish lessons without knowing how many students actually understood the topic. Feedback on assignments is also time-consuming, which delays student improvement and limits teaching effectiveness.

---

## 💡 Solution
**Evalytics** is an **AI-powered teaching insight and feedback platform** that helps educators understand student learning through surveys and provide meaningful, personalized feedback — all in one place.

Students regularly complete short surveys after lessons, and Evalytics analyzes their responses to show what students understood, what they struggled with, and where teaching can improve. Teachers also use Evalytics to write and deliver clear, personalized feedback on assignments.
